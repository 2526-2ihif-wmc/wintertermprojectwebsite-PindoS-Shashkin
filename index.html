    <h2>What is War Thunder?</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
            To start with, I’d like to share my personal experience with the game. I enjoy playing across all modes—tanks, aircraft, and naval battles—which makes the variety especially appealing.
            As mentioned earlier, War Thunder is a free-to-play game, and that naturally raises the ongoing controversy: is it truly free-to-play, or does it lean toward pay-to-win? In many ways, the debate is understandable. A free-to-play model still needs to generate revenue, and the question becomes how fairly that balance is struck between paying players and those who prefer to play without spending money.
