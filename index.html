    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
            To start with, I’d like to share my personal experience with the game. I enjoy playing across all modes—tanks, aircraft, and naval battles—which makes the variety especially appealing.
            As mentioned earlier, War Thunder is a free-to-play game, and that naturally raises the ongoing controversy: is it truly free-to-play, or does it lean toward pay-to-win? In many ways, the debate is understandable. A free-to-play model still needs to generate revenue, and the question becomes how fairly that balance is struck between paying players and those who prefer to play without spending money.
            Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice: some players decide to spend money to speed up progression, while others embrace the grind with stock vehicles—even if those can sometimes be frustrating or difficult to play. Both approaches are valid, and each offers its own kind of satisfaction.
            <br>Speaking from my own experience, I’ve invested more than 8,000 hours into War Thunder. With that amount of time, I feel confident in saying I’ve seen nearly every aspect of the game, and I have enough perspective to share a well-rounded view of its strengths, challenges, and the realities of its free-to-play model.
