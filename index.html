    <h2>What is War Thunder?</h2>
    <p>
        This website is made to help you understand what War Thunder is.
        War Thunder is a free-to-play online military vehicle combat game developed by
        <a href="https://gaijinent.com/">Gaijin Entertainment</a> and released on December 21st, 2016.
        It focuses on realistic battles using vehicles from the 1930s up to modern day. It has more then 2800 vehicles.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
            To start with, I’d like to share my personal experience with the game. I enjoy playing across all modes—tanks, aircraft, and naval battles—which makes the variety especially appealing.
            As mentioned earlier, War Thunder is a free-to-play game, and that naturally raises the ongoing controversy: is it truly free-to-play, or does it lean toward pay-to-win? In many ways, the debate is understandable. A free-to-play model still needs to generate revenue, and the question becomes how fairly that balance is struck between paying players and those who prefer to play without spending money.
            Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice: some players decide to spend money to speed up progression, while others embrace the grind with stock vehicles—even if those can sometimes be frustrating or difficult to play. Both approaches are valid, and each offers its own kind of satisfaction.
            <br>Speaking from my own experience, I’ve invested more than 8,000 hours into War Thunder. With that amount of time, I feel confident in saying I’ve seen nearly every aspect of the game, and I have enough perspective to share a well-rounded view of its strengths, challenges, and the realities of its free-to-play model.

        <h2>Interface Interaction</h2>
        <p>
            Many players often complain about the interface, calling it outdated (and they are right). <a href="#launcher" class="clickable">Launcher</a><br>
            However, BVVD (the project manager) has stated that there will be no interface changes.
            Due to the size and complexity of the game, updating the interface would almost certainly introduce a large number of bugs.

                You can launch the game through Steam or download the official launcher, which looks a bit outdated.
                The minimal client weighs 23.2 GB — not much, but it does not include high‑quality textures.
                The full client weighs 65.9 GB, which is the version I personally use.
                You can also download the Ultra HQ texture pack, which increases the size to 135.7 GB.

        <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
        <p>
            There are 10 main nations in War Thunder, each offering more than 100 unique vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
            War Thunder offers three main battle modes, each providing a different level of realism and challenge.
            These modes are available across all types of battles—tanks, aircraft, and naval combat (main info will be on realistic battles):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arcade Battles</strong> – fast-paced and accessible, with simplified physics and mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Realistic Battles</strong> – more authentic handling and combat, requiring tactical awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulator Battles</strong> – the most immersive mode, with full realism and no HUD assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <table class="game-modes">
            <thead>

        <p>
            There are also a few game modes that are not as common as the ones above, such as Air PvE Arcade and Ground PvE Arcade, where you can earn boosters for farming.
            There are also Squadron Battles, which will be described later.
        </p>

        <h3>Squadron Battles</h3>
        <p>
            Squadron Battles are a competitive mode where teams fight for rating and seasonal rewards.
            Matches follow Realistic rules but with smaller teams and additional restrictions.
            Coordination, communication, and strong lineups are essential for success, especially during the first two weeks when the Battle Ratings are the most balanced.
            The requirements are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A squadron with 8 or more players (128 max)</li>
            <li>Team communication (usually via Discord)</li>
            <li>Top vehicles of the required Battle Rating (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Every squadron has its own rating, which it earns by winning Squadron Battles.
            At the end of each period, usually lasting around two months, squadrons receive rewards based on their final placement.
            The Battle Ratings change every week — for example, the first week is 13.0, the second week is 12.0, and so on.
            The battles themselves differ from Realistic only in that each team has 8 players (4 of them can take a fighter or a helicopter), and
            <strong>ally positions are not shown unless they are within 800 meters</strong>.
            Fighters are the most valuable players in the match, and the outcome often depends on them. This is why even an average pilot can be more impactful than a good tank player.
            The enemy team may also have anti‑air defense vehicles, but they are usually not strong enough to reliably win a 1v1 against a skilled pilot — nobody truly knows how it will go.
            Most squadrons prefer to play during the first (13.0) and second week, because these offer the fairest and most balanced Battle Ratings.
            If you don’t understand what I mean, I can explain why.

            The <a href="#bi" class="clickable">BI</a> is a Soviet
            <strong>rocket‑powered fighter</strong> at 6.7 BR.
            It has incredible acceleration, speed, small size, and agility,
            while <a href="#others" class="clickable">others</a> at this BR still use propeller engines.
        </p>

        <div id="bi" class="fullscreen">

            <img src="images/Bi.png">
            <p>
                The BI was an experimental Soviet rocket interceptor.
                Extremely fast, tiny, and highly maneuverable — but with very limited fuel.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="others" class="fullscreen">

            <p>
                Most aircraft at 6.7 BR are still propeller‑driven,
                making them much slower and less agile compared to the BI.

        <p>
            The <a href="#obj279" class="clickable">Object 279</a> is a Soviet
            <strong>nuclear‑capable heavy tank</strong> at 9.0 BR.
            It features a powerful shell, a two‑plane stabilizer, circular armor protection,
            and surprisingly good mobility for its weight.
        </p>

                Object 279 is capable of surviving a direct hit from a 1000 kg bomb thanks to its unique hull design.

        <p>
            The <a href="#PT1614" class="clickable">PT16/14 mod.</a> is a German
            <strong>experimental MBT</strong> at 11.0 BR.
            It features a laser rangefinder, a two‑plane stabilizer, excellent mobility at around 30 hp/t,
            and a 4‑second reload — the best value at this BR.
        </p>

                This tank counts as two vehicles in battle due to its performance.

        <p>
            These vehicles demonstrate your credit‑card strength if you’re willing to spend <strong>$1400</strong> on a single tank.
