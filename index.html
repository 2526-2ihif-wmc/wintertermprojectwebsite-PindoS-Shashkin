    <h2>What is War Thunder?</h2>

    <p>
        War Thunder is a free-to-play online military combat game developed by
        <a href="https://gaijinent.com/">Gaijin Entertainment</a>.
        The game focuses on large-scale battles using military vehicles from different historical periods,
        ranging from the early 20th century to modern warfare.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project combines air, ground, and naval combat into a single battlefield,
        allowing players to participate in combined-arms battles where different vehicle types
        interact with each other in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
        War Thunder is known for its realistic approach to vehicle modeling and combat,
        offering an experience that sits between arcade-style accessibility
        and historically inspired realism.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game is constantly updated with new vehicles, maps, and gameplay improvements,
        making it one of the most content-rich military simulators available today.
    </p>
</div>



<div class="container" id="experience">
    <h2>My Experience</h2>

    <p>
        To begin with, I would like to share my personal experience with War Thunder.
        I actively play across all available vehicle types — ground forces, aircraft,
        and naval units — which makes the overall gameplay experience highly varied and engaging.
    </p>

    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, War Thunder is a free-to-play game, which naturally leads to
        an ongoing discussion within the community: is the game truly free-to-play,
        or does it lean toward a pay-to-win model?
        This debate is understandable, as any free-to-play project must generate revenue,
        raising questions about how fairly the balance is maintained between paying
        and non-paying players.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, the choice comes down to personal preference.
        Some players choose to spend money to speed up progression,
        while others prefer to progress through the game without financial investment,
        even if playing stock vehicles can sometimes be challenging or frustrating.
        Both approaches are valid and offer different forms of satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking from my own experience, I have invested over 8,000 hours into War Thunder.
        With that amount of time spent in the game, I feel confident in saying that I have
        experienced nearly every aspect it has to offer, allowing me to form a well-rounded
        perspective on its strengths, weaknesses, and the realities of its free-to-play model.
    </p>

<div class="container" id="interface-interaction">
    <h2>Interface Interaction</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#hangar-video" class="clickable">The user interface</a> of War Thunder is often a subject of criticism within the community.
        Many players describe it as outdated, complex, or visually overloaded — and to a certain extent,
        these concerns are justified.
        The game features a large number of menus, settings, and informational panels,
        which can feel overwhelming, especially for new players.
    </p>

    <p>
        One frequently discussed element is the
        <a href="#launcher" class="clickable">launcher</a>,
        which serves as the entry point to the game.
        While functional, it reflects an older design philosophy and prioritizes technical control
        over visual simplicity.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to statements from the project management, including BVVD,
        major interface redesigns are currently not planned.
        This decision is largely based on the sheer size and complexity of the game.
        A complete overhaul of the interface could potentially introduce a significant number of bugs
        and negatively impact stability.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a result, War Thunder’s interface continues to evolve slowly through minor adjustments
        rather than large-scale redesigns, prioritizing functionality and reliability
        over modern visual trends.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can launch the game through Steam or download the official launcher, which looks a bit outdated.
        The minimal client weighs 23.2 GB — not much, but it does not include high‑quality textures.
        The full client weighs 65.9 GB, which is the version I personally use.
        You can also download the Ultra HQ texture pack, which increases the size to 135.7 GB.

<div class="container" id="features-&-mechanics">
    <h2>Features & Mechanics</h2>

    <p>
        War Thunder is built around a set of complex gameplay mechanics that aim to balance
        realism with accessibility. Instead of relying on traditional health bars,
        the game uses a detailed damage model where individual components of a vehicle
        can be disabled or destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#features-video" class="clickable">For ground vehicles</a>, this includes armor thickness, armor type, armor angles, shell penetration,
        and internal modules such as ammunition racks, engines, and crew members.
        A single well-placed shot can be enough to destroy a vehicle if critical components are hit. <a href="#test-drive-ground" class="clickable">Test drive</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Aircraft mechanics focus on realistic flight physics, energy retention,
        and damage to control surfaces, engines, and fuel systems.
        Damage directly affects aircraft performance, making positioning and maneuvering
        just as important as accurate aiming. <a href="#test-drive-air" class="clickable">Test drive</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Naval combat introduces additional mechanics such as compartment flooding,
        fire spread, and crew efficiency.
        Ship survivability depends on damage control and tactical positioning rather than raw durability alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Across all vehicle types, spotting mechanics, ballistics, and realistic projectile behavior
        play a major role.
        Shell drop, travel time, and penetration values must be taken into account,
        rewarding player knowledge and experience.

<div class="container" id="gameplay-overview">
    <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>

    <p>
        War Thunder features ten main nations, each offering extensive technology trees
        with more than one hundred unique vehicles.
        These nations cover a wide range of military doctrines and vehicle designs,
        providing varied gameplay styles and tactical approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        The core gameplay revolves around multiplayer battles that combine different vehicle types.
        Players participate in matches using tanks, aircraft, and naval vessels,
        depending on the selected battle type and mode.
    </p>

    <p>
        War Thunder offers three primary battle modes, each providing a different balance
        between accessibility and realism. These modes are available across ground, air,
        and naval battles, with Realistic Battles being the most commonly played:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arcade Battles</strong> – fast-paced gameplay with simplified physics, markers, and assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Realistic Battles</strong> – reduced interface assistance, realistic flight and vehicle handling, and increased tactical depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulator Battles</strong> – maximum realism with no HUD elements and full manual control.</li>
    </ul>

    <table class="game-modes">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Battle Type</th>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        In addition to the main battle modes, the game includes less common modes such as
        Air PvE Arcade and Ground PvE Arcade, which focus on cooperative gameplay and reward farming.
        Competitive modes, such as Squadron Battles, provide an organized team-based experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Squadron Battles</h3>

    <p>
        Squadron Battles are a competitive mode where organized teams compete for ratings
        and seasonal rewards.
        These battles follow Realistic rules but feature smaller team sizes and stricter limitations.
        Success depends heavily on coordination, communication, and lineup selection.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>An active squadron with at least 8 players (up to 128)</li>
        <li>Reliable team communication, typically via voice chat</li>
        <li>Vehicles that meet the required Battle Rating range</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Each squadron has its own rating, which is affected by match results.
        At the end of a season, typically lasting around two months,
        rewards are distributed based on final placement.
        Battle Ratings rotate weekly, influencing vehicle effectiveness and overall balance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Certain vehicles stand out due to their unique characteristics.
        For example, the <a href="#bi" class="clickable">BI</a> is a Soviet rocket-powered fighter
        that demonstrates extreme performance differences compared to <a href="#others" class="clickable">propeller-driven aircraft.</a>
        The <a href="#obj279" class="clickable">Object 279</a> heavy tank showcases advanced armor design
        and firepower, while the <a href="#PT1614" class="clickable">PT16/14 mod.</a> represents
        experimental late Cold War main battle tank concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
        These examples highlight the diversity of vehicle design and the wide range of gameplay
        scenarios that War Thunder offers across different eras and technologies.
    </p>

    </p>
</div>

<div class="container" id="economy">
    <h2>Economy</h2>

    <p>
        War Thunder uses several in-game currencies that define progression and economic balance.
        The main currencies are <strong style="color: darkgrey">Silver Lions</strong>, <strong style="color: cornflowerblue">Research Points</strong>,
        <strong style="color: #ffcc00">Golden Eagles</strong>, and <strong>Gaijin Coins</strong>, each serving a different purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Silver Lions are used for purchasing vehicles, paying repair costs,
        and unlocking vehicle modifications.
        Research Points are required to unlock new vehicles within the technology trees.
        As players progress to higher tiers, both repair costs and research requirements increase significantly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Golden Eagles are a premium currency that can be purchased with real money.
        They can be used to buy premium vehicles, premium account time,
        convert Research Points, purchase crew skills, and unlock modifications instantly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game also features time-limited events and marathons.
        During these events, players can earn exclusive or collectible vehicles
        by completing specific tasks.
        These vehicles can either be kept or sold on the in-game marketplace.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vehicles sold on the marketplace are traded for <strong>Gaijin Coins</strong>,
        a currency with a fixed exchange rate of <strong>1 Gaijin Coin = 1 Euro</strong>.
        Gaijin Coins can be used to purchase premium accounts, premium vehicles,
        Golden Eagles, or other marketplace items, allowing dedicated players
        to obtain premium content without direct financial spending.
    </p>

    <p>
        Progression is organized into ranks within each technology tree.
        These ranks roughly represent historical eras of military equipment.
        To unlock the next rank, players are required to research a minimum number of vehicles
        (usually six), which can force progression through branches
        that may not align with a player’s personal interests or preferred playstyle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Without a premium account, the economic progression can be demanding.
        Slower income and higher maintenance costs at mid and high tiers
        require efficient gameplay and careful resource management.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="container" id="problems">
    <h2>Problems & Controversies</h2>

    <p>
        Despite its depth and long-term popularity, War Thunder is not without its issues.
        One of the most commonly mentioned problems is the steep learning curve for new players.
        Without external guides or community support, it can be difficult to fully understand
        the interface, vehicle mechanics, and progression systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another frequent point of criticism is the pricing of high-tier premium vehicles.
        Some premium packs, especially at higher Battle Ratings,
        can cost up to <strong>80 euros or more</strong>.
        While these vehicles are optional, their pricing raises concerns
        about accessibility and fairness for non-paying players.
    </p>

    <p>
        Balance is also a recurring topic within the community.
        Certain vehicles are sometimes considered to be placed at unusually low
        Battle Ratings compared to their performance,
        which can lead to frustration and uneven matchups.
    </p>

    <p>
        A commonly cited example is the <a href="#bmpt" class="clickable"><strong>BMPT</strong></a>,
        a heavily armed infantry support vehicle that has sparked debates
        regarding its effectiveness relative to its Battle Rating.
    </p>




    <p>
        In addition to balance concerns, some players express dissatisfaction
        with perceived political or promotional bias.
        The Soviet and Russian technology trees are often noted for their strong performance,
        leading to ongoing discussions about national balance and representation.
    </p>

    <p>
        While these issues do not prevent the game from being playable or enjoyable,
        they highlight the challenges of maintaining balance, fairness,
        and accessibility in a long-running free-to-play project.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="bmpt" class="fullscreen"> <a href="#problems" class="close">×</a>
    <img src="images/BMPT.jpg" alt="BMPT">
    <p>
    The BMPT, often called the "Terminator," excels on its battle rating.
    It is equipped with two 30‑mm autocannons and four ATGMs, combining strong firepower with impressive mobility.
    Its armor is exceptional, especially when compared to light tanks, making it a formidable opponent on the battlefield.
</p>
</div>



    <div class="container" id="conclusion">
