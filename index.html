    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>

            To start with I'd like to share my personal experience with the game.
            I enjoy playing tanks, aircraft, and naval battles.
            <br> As it is written above the game is free-to-play, that is why there is a counterversy arouund it wether it is free-to-play or pay-to-win, but from my point of view </p>
        <p>
