    <h2>What is War Thunder?</h2>
    <p>
        This website is made to help you understand what War Thunder is.
        War Thunder is a free-to-play online military vehicle combat game developed by
        <a href="https://gaijinent.com/">Gaijin Entertainment</a> and released on December 21st, 2016.
        It focuses on realistic battles using vehicles from the 1930s up to modern day. It has more then 2800 vehicles.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
            To start with, I’d like to share my personal experience with the game. I enjoy playing across all modes—tanks, aircraft, and naval battles—which makes the variety especially appealing.
            As mentioned earlier, War Thunder is a free-to-play game, and that naturally raises the ongoing controversy: is it truly free-to-play, or does it lean toward pay-to-win? In many ways, the debate is understandable. A free-to-play model still needs to generate revenue, and the question becomes how fairly that balance is struck between paying players and those who prefer to play without spending money.
            Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice: some players decide to spend money to speed up progression, while others embrace the grind with stock vehicles—even if those can sometimes be frustrating or difficult to play. Both approaches are valid, and each offers its own kind of satisfaction.
            <br>Speaking from my own experience, I’ve invested more than 8,000 hours into War Thunder. With that amount of time, I feel confident in saying I’ve seen nearly every aspect of the game, and I have enough perspective to share a well-rounded view of its strengths, challenges, and the realities of its free-to-play model.

        <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
        <p>
            There are 10 main nations in War Thunder, each offering more than 100 unique vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
            War Thunder offers three main battle modes, each providing a different level of realism and challenge.
            These modes are available across all types of battles—tanks, aircraft, and naval combat (main info will be on realistic battles):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arcade Battles</strong> – fast-paced and accessible, with simplified physics and mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Realistic Battles</strong> – more authentic handling and combat, requiring tactical awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulator Battles</strong> – the most immersive mode, with full realism and no HUD assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <table class="game-modes">
            <thead>
            <tr>

        </table>
        <p>
            There are also a few game modes that are not as common as the ones above, such as Air PvE Arcade and Ground PvE Arcade, where you can earn boosters for farming.
            There are also Squadron Battles, which will be described later.
        </p>

        <h3>Squadron Battles</h3>
        <p>Squadron Battles offer high‑skill, team‑based competitive gameplay. The requirements are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A squadron with 8 or more players (128 max)</li>
            <li>Team communication (usually via Discord)</li>
            <li>Top vehicles of the required Battle Rating (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Every squadron has its own rating, which it earns by winning Squadron Battles.
            At the end of each period, usually lasting around two months, squadrons receive rewards based on their final placement.
            The Battle Ratings change every week — for example, the first week is 13.0, the second week is 12.0, and so on.
            The battle itself differ from Reallisitc only that each team has 8 player (4 of them could take fighter or heli) and it does not show where are allys
            Most squadrons prefer to play during the first (13.0) and second week, because it offers the fairest and most balanced Battle Rating.
            If you don’t understand what I mean, I can explain why.
